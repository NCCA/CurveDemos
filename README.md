![alt tag](http://nccastaff.bournemouth.ac.uk/jmacey/GraphicsLib/Demos/Curve.png)

Two demos showing how to use the ngl::BezierCurve class, including an example of exporting from maya using a simple script

Note this branch is an older version and will not be maintained as it uses the old OpenGL widget
